If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

    After calculating averages, I would compare these numbers with the descrption provided by Spotify.
    For example a 'Yellow' aura listener based on those descriptions and parameters, in my opinion,
    would have mid to mid-high energy, mid to mid-high valence and mid danceability.

Hypothesize about why the way you’ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener.
What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

    With the other parameters inside the database,
    we can more accurately characterize the listener's preferences and
    put them in a category better suited for them.
    Also in an extreme or edge case create a new category if said combinations
    of parameter average values is not yet represented by spotify's margins.
